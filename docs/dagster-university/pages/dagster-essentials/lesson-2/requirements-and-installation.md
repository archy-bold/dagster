## Requirements

To install Dagster, youâ€™ll need:

*   Python 3.8+
*   A package manager like pip or poetry. If you need to install a package manager, refer to the following installation guides:
    *   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

```shell
python --version
pip --version
```
